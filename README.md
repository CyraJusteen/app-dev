## About the Movie
*Inside Out* follows the inner workings of the mind of Riley, a young girl who adapts to her family's relocation as five personified emotions administer her thoughts and actions.

Director **Pete Docter** conceived *Inside Out* in October 2009 after observing changes in his daughter's personality as she grew older. Docter invited **Ronnie del Carmen**, who had previously worked as story supervisor on *Finding Nemo* (2003) and *Up* (2009), to come on as co-director, a role del Carmen accepted. They sought inspiration for the film from their own personal histories and experiences, including del Carmen's inspiration through his upbringing, and consulted psychologists and neuroscientists in an effort to portray the mind with greater accuracy. The film's principal characters were cast in August 2013. Development lasted for five and a half years. *Inside Out* debuted at the **68th Cannes Film Festival** on May 18, 2015, and was released in the United States on June 19.
